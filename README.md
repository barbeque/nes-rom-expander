# ROM expander
Intended to be a Python replacement for the Windows-only "ROM Expander Pro," this expander is currently only hardcoded to follow the instructions to convert a copy of the Portopia Serial Murder Case.

In the future, it may one day be expanded to support [the entire set of ROM Expander instructions](https://github.com/btimofeev/UniPatcher/wiki/ROM-Expander-Pro).
